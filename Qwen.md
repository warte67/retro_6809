# Reminder File: alpha_6809

## Project Overview

### The alpha_6809 project is a 6809 processor emulator written in C++.
It aims to provide a complete and accurate simulation of the 6809 processor, including CPU emulation, memory management, and peripheral interfaces.
Key Concepts and Components

### CPU Emulation
How the 6809 processor is emulated (e.g., instruction set, registers, etc.)
Any notable optimizations or custom implementations used
Peripheral Interfaces
Description of the various peripherals supported (e.g., memory, I/O interfaces, etc.)
How they interact with the CPU and each other

### Memory Management
Explanation of the memory model used (e.g., segmented memory, flat memory, etc.)
Details on how memory is allocated and managed
Architecture and Design Decisions

### Overall Architecture
High-level overview of the codebase's structure and organization
Key interfaces and abstraction layers used

### Design Decisions
Description of any notable design choices or trade-offs made
Rationale behind specific implementation decisions
Code-Specific Information

### Core Data Structures
Description of key data structures used (e.g., memory maps, register banks, etc.)
Explanation of their purpose and how they're used throughout the codebase

### Critical Code Snippets
Provide 3-5 code snippets that illustrate critical concepts or interfaces
Refactoring Context

### Goals and Objectives
What specific problems are you trying to address through refactoring?
What benefits do you expect from the refactored codebase?
