## Project Overview

### Briefly describe the project, its goals, and your vision for refactoring
Key concepts and components that will help me understand the codebase
Key Concepts and Components

## CPU Emulation
###How the 6809 processor is emulated (e.g., instruction set, registers, etc.)
Any notable optimizations or custom implementations used
Peripheral Interfaces
Description of the various peripherals supported (e.g., memory, I/O interfaces, etc.)
How they interact with the CPU and each other
## Memory Management
### Explanation of the memory model used (e.g., segmented memory, flat memory, etc.)
Details on how memory is allocated and managed
Architecture and Design Decisions

## Overall Architecture
### High-level overview of the codebase's structure and organization
Key interfaces and abstraction layers used
Design Decisions
Description of any notable design choices or trade-offs made
Rationale behind specific implementation decisions
Code-Specific Information

## Core Data Structures
### Description of key data structures used (e.g., memory maps, register banks, etc.)
Explanation of their purpose and how they're used throughout the codebase
Critical Code Snippets
Provide 2-3 code snippets that illustrate critical concepts or interfaces
Refactoring Context

## Goals and Objectives
### What specific problems are you trying to address through refactoring?
What benefits do you expect from the refactored codebase?
Key Areas of Focus
Identify areas where refactoring is most crucial (e.g., performance bottlenecks, code duplication, etc.)
