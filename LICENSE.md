# GPL v3 License

The following is the full text of the **GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL-3.0)**.

### Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer."

The GPLv3 license is designed to protect your freedom to share and change all versions of a program â€” to make sure it remains free software for all its users. It also protects the users from being locked into proprietary software that they cannot modify or share.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS

#### 0. Definitions.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it is released under the terms of this License. The "Program," below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a modified version of it.

#### 1. Source Code.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, and any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.

#### 2. Basic Permissions.

You may copy, modify, distribute, and sublicense the Program, provided you meet the terms and conditions of this License.

#### 3. Protecting Users' Freedom.

To protect the users' freedom, you must ensure that any modified versions of the Program are also free. Thus, you must provide access to the source code when distributing binaries or executable versions of the Program.

#### 4. Conveying Modified Versions.

You may modify the Program and distribute your modifications under the terms of this License. When distributing modified versions, you must add a prominent notice stating that you have changed the Program.

#### 5. No Warranty.

The Program is licensed "as is," without any warranty. You accept responsibility for determining the suitability of the program and its use.

#### 6. Termination.

If you fail to comply with the terms of this License, your rights to use, modify, and distribute the Program are terminated.
