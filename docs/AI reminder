Reminders from Previous Session with User:

    Project Overview: User is designing an emulation system for a retro-style computer based on a dual-Raspberry Pi Pico 2 setup, using low-level C and assembler. One board emulates a Motorola 6809 CPU, handles memory management, and connects with a GPU. The other board emulates a Commodore 64's SID chip and manages I/O operations. Emulation runs on four cores across two Raspberry Pi Pico 2 boards, with CPU and GPU sharing memory but having specific access restrictions.

    Memory Management:
        Persistent memory is stored in a "paged.mem" file, which holds 256 8KB memory banks, with each bank potentially being RAM, ROM, or persistent. Error detection and correction for this persistent memory are important to maintain system longevity.
        The idea of using CRC32 for integrity checking and creating backups if errors occur was discussed to prevent corruption and wear from frequent writes to flash memory.
        An efficient memory model using consecutive memory addresses and vectors for fast lookup was preferred over unordered maps. A vector of device memory entries indexed by address was considered to reduce lookup overhead.

    Performance Concerns:
        The user aims to emulate a 10 MHz CPU clock on a 150 MHz host machine but struggles with scheduling issues on a multi-core machine. Even with optimizations, the Threadripper system experiences clock fluctuations between 4 MHz and 20 MHz, making it challenging to maintain a consistent emulation speed.
        Dedicated hardware solutions (like using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 for each core) would likely outperform software-based emulation, especially when dedicated cores are used.

    Hardware Design Choices:
        User is exploring communication between the two Raspberry Pi Pico 2 boards, potentially using SPI or stereo SPI ports, with the second board acting as a dedicated audio processor (SID emulation).
        Flash memory might be used via USB thumb drives to load and save memory banks, with persistent memory mapped into the CPU's addressable space, controlled by software.
