# retro_6809
A complete refactoring of the alpha_6809 project. This is a work in progress. Please check back later for updates.

### Project Summary: **The Dream 6809 Computer Reimagined**

## Overview

The **retro_6809** project is a fully open-source retro computing project designed to replicate the vision of a 6809-based computer with modern components. Using two Raspberry Pi Pico 2 boards, this project brings together the power of the **Motorola 6809** CPU emulation with modern peripherals, graphics, audio, and general-purpose input/output capabilities. It provides an environment for **students** and **developers** to learn about hardware design, embedded systems, operating systems, and video game development.

### Historical Context and Motivation

The project draws inspiration from the 1980s era, specifically from my experience programming on the TRS-80 Color Computer and the Commodore 64. I started out programming in **BASIC**, which was too slow for my needs. I soon switched to assembly for the **Motorola 6809** processor, but I couldn't help but notice that my nephewâ€™s **Commodore 64** had better graphics and sound capabilities. While I did learn assembly for the **C64**, I still longed for a machine that combined the 6809's power with better graphics and sound.

The **retro_6809** project aims to fulfill that dream. By using modern Raspberry Pi Pico 2 boards, we have a platform that provides the **6809 emulation** along with rich hardware features.

## Hardware Architecture

Each **Raspberry Pi Pico 2** board has **two processor cores**. The system uses two **Pico 2** boards, each playing a specific role:

- **Core 1 on Board 1:** Cycle-accurate **6809 emulation**, system clock generation, and memory management.
- **Core 2 on Board 1:** **GPU emulation** that drives VGA output, manages pixel streaming, and generates **HSYNC** and **VSYNC** signals.
- **Core 1 on Board 2:** **Commodore SID emulation** for FM audio synthesis.
- **Core 2 on Board 2:** Manages **USB peripherals** (keyboard, mouse, joysticks, storage) and communication with a host PC for debugging.

Additionally, **32 GPIO pins** are exposed for external projects.

### Graphics Capabilities

The **GPU** on Board 1 (Core 2) uses **12 GPIO pins** to generate VGA output through resistor ladders, supporting three color channels (0V to 0.7V). The system features:

- **256-color palette** (A4R4G4B4 format) with up to **4096 colors**.
- **64KB GPU-addressable background buffer** for a **320x200 display** with 256 colors.
- **8KB CPU-addressable foreground layer** for low-resolution text and graphics.
- **Sprites:** Supports up to **64 sprites** with collision detection. The first **16 sprites** support pixel-level collision, and **bounding-box** collision is supported for the first **32 sprites**. These sprites use a **4x4 collision mask**.
- **Tiles:** A fuly featured 16x16 tilemap system is planned, but not yet designed.

### Memory Architecture

The system uses a **2MB paged memory system**:

- **8KB of addressable memory** pages through the entire **2MB memory**.
- Each page can be **RAM, ROM, or Persistent memory**. Persistent memory is used to save application states when the page is switched.
  
Additionally, there are **512 bytes of hardware registers** available, which can be programmatically addressed for devices such as the GPU, Keyboard, Joysticks, USB Storage, Floating Point Math, and more.

## Software Features

This project includes a **cycle-accurate emulator** of the **Motorola 6809**, providing a platform for both retro and modern software development. The emulator includes a **VGA graphics output**, a **FM audio synthesizer**, and a **fully functional I/O system** with USB support for peripherals.

### Use Cases for Education

The **retro_6809** project serves as a hands-on platform for teaching:

- **Microcontroller design** and embedded systems.
- **Operating systems** and **kernel development** for low-level programming.
- **Video game design**, hardware interfacing, and graphics programming.
- Understanding the **basics of assembly language** and retro computing.
